The patient is expected to arrive on Tuesday morning by air ambulance from West Africa, officials said in a statement, and will be treated in the same isolation unit as two previous patients with the virus, who have been discharged from the hospital.

The hospital did not provide any information on the patient.

"We are bound by patient confidentiality and have no information regarding the status of the incoming patient," Emory officials said in a statement.

A U.S. medical missionary infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia is currently being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, where on Monday he was able to eat breakfast and listen to music, his wife said in a statement.

Two other U.S. missionaries who contracted the disease in July were treated at Emory, where they were given the experimental drug ZMapp.

No more doses of ZMapp are available, and doctors have said it is not clear whether it helped their recovery.
